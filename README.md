## Introduction

The Checkout Link Generator is a straightforward web tool designed to simplify the process of generating direct checkout links, particularly useful for e-commerce platforms and individual sellers. This application enables users to dynamically create checkout links based on specific product IDs and sizes, facilitating a smoother transaction process.

## Features

- **Dynamic Link Generation**: Automatically generates a checkout link when the user inputs a product URL and selects a size.
- **SKU Verification**: Offers an option to input and verify the SKU to ensure the link corresponds to the correct product.
- **Interactive Feedback**: Utilizes toast notifications to provide real-time feedback about the link generation process.

## How to Use

1. Open the web application.
2. Enter the product URL and the SKU in the designated fields.
3. Select the desired size for the product.
4. Click the "Generate Link" button.
5. The application will display a "Generating..." message, followed by a toast notification indicating the success or failure of the operation.
6. If successful, a "Checkout" button will appear, directing the user to the generated link.
